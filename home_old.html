				<h3>Front-End</h3><h4>HTML, CSS and Javascript,<br>jQuery and Bootstrap</h4>
				<p>The core languages of front end web development are a strongsuit of mine.  Javascript, including jQuery, is the go-to language for manipulating data on the front end, and one of my favorite languages to use.  Creating a good front-end design is one of the most satisfying aspects of web development.  I'm also comfortable creating responsive web designs using bootstrap.</p>

				<h3>Back-End</h3><h4>PHP, SQL and NoSQL</h4>
				<p>I have project experience with server-side languages such as PHP and Ruby on Rails, as well as databases.  For an example of Ruby on Rails please refer to my Betcha project <a class="colorful" href="https://github.com/kdr213/Betcha">on github</a>. An example of my database programming skills can be seen in a project from college, where I designed a database system and interface to model an airline company, complete with data generation software.  This project can be seen <a class="colorful" href="https://github.com/kdr213/Airline_project_final">here</a>.</p>

				<h3>Applications</h3><h4>Java and C++</h4>
				<p>Java is my go-to object oriented language, and I use it to implement algorithms and develop models.  My senior project at Lehigh was an Android application that used Java and it's Android libraries.  The project can be viewed <a class="colorful" href="https://github.com/kdr213/GP-Cam_Final">on github</a>.  I recently implemented a genetic algorithm in Java, modelling protein synthesis.  Check the repository page for further info. C++ was one of the first languages I learned, and still one of my favorites.  One of my proudest projects was creating a compiler in C++ for a language similar to Assembly.  This project can be seen <a class="colorful" href="https://github.com/kdr213/Compiler-Project-CSE109">here</a>.</p>
